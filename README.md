## 💡 Mission

To build a decentralized ecosystem where African farmers can access:
- Verified agro knowledge,
- Transparent supply chain data,
- Veterinary services,
- Community-driven support,
- And crypto-based incentives.

## 🚜 Why Agrochain?

> 🌍 Millions of smallholder farmers in Africa lack access to reliable tools, information, and market access. Agrochain bridges this gap using Web3.

### ❌ Problems We Solve:
- Lack of access to trusted veterinary advice
- No record-keeping of livestock or crops
- Limited awareness of crypto/web3 benefits
- Fragmented agro-communities

### ✅ Our Solution:
- Decentralized Agro-vet Hub (coming soon)
- Community education programs on Web3
- Agro Profiles for every farmer
- Reward system using $AGC token (to be launched)
- Integration with Hedera DLT for fast and low-cost operations

---

## 🔩 Core Features (MVP)

- 📘 **AgroProfile**: Every farmer gets a digital ID
- 🐄 **VetConnect**: Ask vets via platform and get trusted guidance
- 🎓 **AgroClassroom**: Free videos and guides on Web3 & Farming
- 💬 **AgroCommunity**: Connect with others and earn tokens
