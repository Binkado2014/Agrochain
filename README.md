# 🌾 Agrochain

Agrochain is a decentralized solution designed to empower African farmers by using blockchain technology to bring transparency, trust, and tokenized access to farming inputs, produce, and community-based finance.

## 🚀 Overview

Agrochain focuses on building tools for:
- Tokenization of crops and farmer contributions
- Transparent supply chain records using smart contracts
- Decentralized farmer identity system
- A lightweight MVP dApp for onboarding smallholder farmers

We aim to bridge the gap between Web3 innovation and real-world agriculture challenges.

- **Frontend:** ReactJS / Svelte (planned)
- **Storage & Identity:** IPFS, possible integration with Polygon ID or Ceramic
